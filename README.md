# Cryptography Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various encryption and decryption algorithms in different programming languages (```JAVA``` and ```Python```). The goal is to provide simple and easy-to-understand code for educational and practical purposes.

## Algorithms Included

- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**
- **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)**
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
- **Blowfish**
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the algorithms, you will need the following installed on your system (depending on the language you're using):
- Python 3.x
- Java JDK


### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamo08/encryption-decryption.git
2. Go to the folder
   ```bash
   cd encryption-decryption
