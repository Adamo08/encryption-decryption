# Cryptography Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various encryption and decryption algorithms in Python. The goal is to provide simple and easy-to-understand code for educational and practical purposes.

## Algorithms Included

- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Affine Cipher**
- **Vigen√®re Cipher**
- **Hill Cipher**
- **DES (Data Encryption Standard)**
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the algorithms, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adamo08/encryption-decryption.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
